	    <h3>Technology and good design have one thing in common: they should both be about the human need. A collaboration between HKT Premier and renowned local architects and interior designers, the goal of the“iot in Style”design series is to show how technology will be used in the future home design.  The series will be displayed at the HKT concept store.</h3>
	    <p>Technology plays a vital role in our daily lives. From entertainment to automated systems, and office facilities to security systems, technology is the backbone of it all. The Tech Team at HKT Premier is the mastermind behind the system integration of the "iot in Style" series; while the architects and designers took on the important task of creating a home that is beautiful as it is functional. With IoT as the building block, architects and designers found inspirations from a range of home products to present their own idea of a modernized home, complete with convenience, comfort, and joy of a smart home.

      <p class="ques">Q: What do you feel about being the first designer for “iot in Style”?</p>
      <p class="ans">A: I feel honoured to be a part of this program. Through this collaborative effort, I get to know more about smart homes. I hope that I can bring out the latest technology in my home design, and prove that you don’t have to give up aesthetics to accommodate technology in your home.</p>
      <p class="ques">Q: Where do you get inspirations for your design in this series? What is the focus of your design?</p>
      <p class="ans">A: In traditional Chinese thinking, “home” is where one’s base is. I adopted “home” as the theme, and used nature as my inspirations. In the end, I decided to use wood extensively throughout my design. The idea is to go back to basic, and use the simplest and most traditional material to build the structure. Not a single metal nail was used. Instead, I used the ancient building method to create a structure that is sound and sturdy. The result is a comfortable, natural, and tight-knit home. My design also incorporated some of the elements from HKT Premier, including music and lighting. Using smart technology does not only create change, but also introduces a new lifestyle. I hope that my design will encourage people to rethink what their home should be.</p>
      <p class="ques">Q: What is a connected home? How is its application in Hong Kong?</p>
      <p class="ans">A: Connected home is becoming more popular by the day. It has also become more humanized and user-friendly. A lot of my clients are looking for connected home design as much as they are looking for style. Connected home has become more of a lifestyle. The design of connected home components are also getting more sophisticated. Functionality and aesthetic becomes one. When we say "design aesthetics," we are actually talking about a new style of living, where homeowners can experience a new level of quality life from their smart home.</p>
      <p class="ques">Q: As IoT becomes more popular, would it be the trend of future home design in Hong Kong?</p>
      <p class="ans">A: I see the Internet of Things (IoT) as inspirations of living. The availability of mobile data and wifi helped expand the offerings of IoT home products. For example, when the weather is hot, homeowners can turn on their air conditioning units remotely from their mobile phones before they get home. Lights at home will be turned on or off automatically; blinds will go up or down depending on the strength of the sunlight and temperature. A connected home is more than a modern way of life. It is also helping us protect the environment.</p>
      <p class="ques">Q: Design is about aesthetics and connected home is often seen as a utilitarian technology. How do you make the two work together?</p>
      <p class="ans">A: There’s a lot of learning and exploring involved. As a designer, I have to learn about the products. But, more importantly, I have to understand my client’s needs. In order to design a perfect connected home for my client, I have to learn their lifestyle and daily routines.</p>
      <p class="ques">Q: How does the HKT Premier services help designers and homeowners? How does it support the Internet of Things?</p>
      <p class="ans">A: Although clients are more knowledgeable about connected home, most of them don’t know much about its applications. HKT Premier offers huge support on this end. Its extensive optic fiber network makes it a reality to build a connected home. The customer service and IT teams at HKT Premier is also a great resource. They have the latest information on IoT and understand the client’s needs. They are a one-stop destination for all connected home needs. </p>
      <p class="ques">Q: What are you hoping to accomplish in this collaboration?</p>
      <p class="ans">A: Most people think that a connected home lacks the human touch, and that it is not very inviting. I want to change this prejudice with my design. That’s why I used the theme of “Home” and a lot of natural materials in my design. I want to shorten the distance between technology and us. We don’t have to think too far. We should focus on what we want in a home, what we want in our lives. It’s easy to be distracted and misled by all the noises out there. But we just need to remember that what is popular is not necessarily what is right for you. Products are simply tools to improve our lives. We should be the ones driving the direction of our own lives.</p>
