	    <h3>With the rapid advancement of technology, the future seems far away. Yet, it can be closer to us than you think. Take the internet as an example. It became widely available only since the late 1990s. In these short 20 years, the internet has changed the world. We are more connected to each other than ever.</h3>
	    <h3>It's now the Internet of Things (IoT). Objects can interact with people and surroundings according to both data programmed in the objects as well as data collected by the objects from past usage. </h3>
	    <p>They adjust their performance according to your likes, habits, and even health conditions. Perhaps you still can't quite put your finger on the loT connected home. It's time to be prepared and get acquainted to it.</p>
	    <h2>Human Touch</h2>
	    <h3>IoT is coming to us at an astounding pace. It's changing the way we live, from the intelligent home to medical treatment, electric car to entertainment to home security and energy management.</h3>
	    <p>Today, using a mobile app to monitor and control home appliances in an automated home is nothing new. Voice-control smart appliances are everywhere. The next stage of IoT living is that smart appliances will interact with each other to create the most comfortable surroundings according to their settings. For example, smart refrigerator can identify the different types of food and remind you of the expiration date. It can also create meal plans according to the user's BMI, make a shopping list when supplies are low, and re-stock the fridge through online shopping.</p>
	    <p>IoT connected home is no longer limited to just one home. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) can help us reach out to the world further. Users can connect with family and friends around the world like never before. Technology companies are looking into how to simulate the touch of various surfaces. Using VR equipment, not only can grandparents see their grandchildren who are studying abroad, but they can also hold their hands and give them a hug. </p>

     <h2>Designing a Connected Home</h2>
     <h3>The key to IoT is connection. Without a high-speed, secure, and stable connection, even the best-designed equipment will fall short. An optic fiber network is the core. Whether your home is single or multi-level, with a reliable wi-fi connection, you can use your smart phone or loT connected robot to control the lights, shades, AV system, security system, and even charge your electric vehicle. </h3>
     <p>A well-conceived connected home starts with good planning. The home network should be tailor made and subject to the needs of its users. The network should cover the entire home and should be equipped to accommodate new IoT products or smart appliances that will be available in the future. </p>
