          <h3>Lutron Automated Shades and Home Control Systems</h3>
          <p> 
Automated shades are a hot item for smart homes. Lutron has always been in the forefront of this development. Its new generation of blinds offer a range of protection options from sheer, dim-out, to blackout fabrics. Whether it is your bedroom windows, skylights, ventilation windows, or windows in hidden corners of your home, with the touch of a button on the remote control, you can easily manage your blinds with ultra-quiet performance and precision. You can choose to have your shades start, move, and stop in unison, maintaining perfect alignment with each other. Or you can have individual blinds at different heights and angles, which can all be programmed for ease of control. The HomeWorks QS series, designed for larger homes, integrates the control of all your light, interior and exterior, electric light and daylight. The system also integrates with audio-visual and HVAC control, all under the control of a remote control, smart phone, or smart watch.
